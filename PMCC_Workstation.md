# PMCC_Workstation Guide
**Guide to using PMCC Workstations at WangLab**

## Intro
There are currently 4 Workstations at WangLab
- **Location**: 101 College St (south-west corner of College/Elizabeth), Princess Margaret Cancer Research Tower, 7th Floor
- **Naming**: A1, A2, A3, A4 in order. (A1 is the one near printer)
- **Open Network**: Yes

## User Guide/Lab Rules
- These 4 workstations are not connected and managed through server. Thus, user
accounts are local to the workstation you are working on. It is highly recommended that each user only access one workstation and should declare which machine to use in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1To9JrYZcd5FZFrzHiaQGzFXrcgASrOux8dERRElwdnA/edit)

- Each user account will not have root access. Thus, each user can only install software/package that doesn't require root access.

- If you have to install software/package that requires root access, you should declare the
software/package in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1To9JrYZcd5FZFrzHiaQGzFXrcgASrOux8dERRElwdnA/edit) and notice Dr. Bo Wang.

## How to use shared package
Although the 4 workstations are not connected, they do have a shared package folder mounted on all machines. Make sure to check the shared package folder first before installing new package/software.
 - **Path**: `/pkgs/`
 - **Current package**: Anaconda2, Anaconda3
 - **Sample Usage**: For example to use Anaconda3, you can type: `source /pkgs/scripts/use-anaconda3.sh`. It is recommended that you should create specific environment for each project you are working on.
